ADVANCED PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF CLASSROOM SCORES
Introduction: The need for Granular Academic Insight
In modern classroom settings, educators are tasked with not only assigning grades but also understanding the performance distribution of their students. Simple class averages are insufficient for identifying pedagogical issues, customizing differentiated instruction, or pointing out students who are excelling or struggling across specific subjects. Class quality is defined by more than just mean score, but by the variance and median. 
The manual way of calculating student statistics is very time consuming and provides rudimentary feedback. Schools require an automated tool to perform sophisticated statistical analysis across multiple subjects and identify the student with the highest performance based on an aggregate performance metric.
Impact and Significance
Educators lack an automated to quickly perform sophisticated statistical analysis across multiple subjects. This has led to inability to efficiently compute and interpret key descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for individual subjects, assess subject difficulty and accurately rank students based on overall calculated average.
Goals and Objectives 
Goal: To develop a Python-based academic script that processes a structured database of student test scores, generate descriptive statistics for each subject and identify top performing student overall in class.
Objectives  
1.To load a dataset containing student names and scores for at least three subjects
2.To calculate mean, median and standard deviation of each student.
3.To calculate overall average of each student across all subjects
4.To identify and report the highest average score overall 
5.To ensure the use of python inbuilt libraries to perform all the computations
Proposed solution and outcome
The solution will employ python’s capabilities to achieve computational efficiency and statistical accuracy.
Required Libraries
Pandas: For loading data (from CSV and Excel files) and execution of grouped and vectorized statistical data
NumPy: Internally used by Pandas For efficient statistical operations
Matplotlib: For translating statistical data into visual reports like graphs, bar charts.
 The analysis will be carried in the sequential ways below;
Data loading and structure. Load student score data with structured columnscd
Subject level analysis. Iterate through subject columns, calculate descriptive analysis and present results showing distribution of scores of each subject.
Overall student performance calculation. Calculate average score of each student, store it in a data frame which will be used for student ranking.
Top performer identification. Find student with the highest average score and retrieve the student’s name
Determine the subject with highest and lowest performance. Plot a simple mean bar chart.
Determine overall top 5 students basing on overall average. Plot a student rankin bar chart.
The successful deployment of the python script will transform analysis from manual to automated. This will lead to:
Time saving: Teachers will focus more on individual feedback and lesson planning instead of doing assessment computations manually.
Targeted intervention: Teachers will be able to identify and support students failing below the median.
Instructional improvement: Teachers will able to get immediate feedback on their teaching material and make immediate changes to improve.
In conclusion, the problem will be solved when the python script process input data and outputs a clear formatted
